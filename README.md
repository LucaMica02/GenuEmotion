# 🎓 Final Project – AI Lab Course

## 🤖 Emotion Recognition & Genuineness Detection

**Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning**

### 📌 Project Description

This project aims to develop a system that can:

- 🔍 Recognize facial emotions (e.g., happy, sad, angry, surprised)
- ✅ Detect the authenticity (genuineness) of those emotions

Built with the power of **computer vision** and **machine learning**, this tool explores both the surface expression and the truth behind it.
